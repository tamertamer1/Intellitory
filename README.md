## Project Description

Traditional inventory management in clinical and lab settings is often manual, slow, and error-prone, leading to stockouts, misplaced items, and poor supply tracking. These issues disrupt operations, raise costs, and put patient care at risk. To address this, we developed an intelligent shelving system using UHF RFID to automate
real-time inventory tracking and make the process easier for users. Our smart shelving system automatically tracks items as they are added or removed, with each shelf unit
featuring a display that shows real-time inventory, giving users instant insight into stock levels. Inventory data syncs wirelessly to a web application, enabling authorized users to remotely monitor, review, and manage updates from anywhere. This ensures accurate, efficient, and reliable inventory control across all platforms and fully streamlines and automates the item/tag tracking process
